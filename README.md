## Abstract
Online discussions are frequently disrupted by toxic behavior, discouraging users
from engaging in meaningful conversations. The Toxic Comments Challenge,
organized by Jigsaw and Google, aims to improve the detection of harmful content,
including threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate speech. 

In this
project, we analyze the dataset provided in the competition to explore word distributions
and identify patterns commonly associated with toxic comments. Several
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including GRU, LSTM, Bidirectional
LSTM, and Bidirectional GRU, are employed for multi-label binary
classification of comments based on toxicity type. The effectiveness of these models
in distinguishing toxic content is evaluated, providing insights that could guide
future improvements in automated content moderation systems.

## Assignments

During the course, four assignments were released to challenge students with different AML problems. Those assignemnts are also present in the main directory of this project.
